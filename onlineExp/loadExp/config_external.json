Next, you will see an image. <b>Try to remember the image</b> as well as you can. We will test your memory for the images in Part II. After the image has disappeared, you will see one of the squares again in its original location. Please indicate if you think this square is the same or a different color as before. In the example above, the bottom-right square has changed color from green to yellow. Part I consists of X such squares-image-square trials.",
